# Stuff to put in thesis 

Thesis chapters:
- explain different merger states and how they are generated: Inspiral (Post-Newtonian), Merger (NR), ringdown (Perturbation theory)
- Why doe we get eccentric waveforms?
- Surrogate modeling:
	- how many sample waveforms (m) are needed for the basis? (what is the maximum allowed error?)
	- Choose your greedy data. Within the parameter domain, choose the m datapoints (eccentricity and mean anomoly) that best approximates the entire waveform.
	- Choose m time-samples that best define a waveform. This is the emperical data. Use Emperical Interpolation method (EIM)
	- At every emperical point generate a waveform with one of the greedy data points. (at t=100 ms, generate waveform with ecc=0.3, mean anomoly=1/2pi)
